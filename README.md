# ThreddedCreateApp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thredded/thredded_create_app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thredded/thredded_create_app) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/thredded/thredded_create_app/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thredded/thredded_create_app/coverage)

**THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS REPO AND IS NOT YET USABLE**.

Generates a Rails app with the [Thredded](https://github.com/thredded/thredded) forums engine installed.

This generator will create a new Rails app with the following configuration:

* Database: PostgreSQL.
* Auth: Devise.

See below for more information on the generated app.

Example screenshots of the generated app:

## Pre-requisites

1. Git.
2. PostgreSQL.
3. Ruby 2.3+.

## Usage

Install the gem and create your app:

```bash
gem install thredded_create_app
thredded_create_app myapp
```

### More detailed instructions

Run `thredded_create_app --help` for more information about the available
options.

#### RVM

If you're using [RVM](https://rvm.io/), you probably want to create a
gemset before creating your app:

 ```bash
 RUBY_VERSION=2.3.1 APP=myapp
 rvm use --create "${RUBY_VERSION}@${APP}"
 gem install thredded_create_app
 thredded_create_app "$APP"
 ```
   
Then, generate the `.ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` files so that the gemset
is used automatically whenever you `cd` into the project directory:
 
 ```bash
 cd "$APP"
 rvm use --ruby-version "${RUBY_VERSION}@${APP}"
 printf '.ruby-version\n.ruby-gemset\n' >> .git/info/exclude
 ```

### App generation

The app generator will do the steps below for you.

First, the rubygems package is updated and the latest versions of
[Rails] and [Bundler] are installed.

Then, a Rails app is generated for use with the PostgreSQL database.

Then, a [git] repository is initialized in the app directory. From here onwards,
the app generator will commit the changes at each step.

[RSpec] is used as the testing framework, and some basic acceptance tests
using [capybara] are added.

[Devise] is used as the authentication framework. Its default views are
customized to add a user name field (`display_name`) to the registration form.
The [simple_form] gem is used for the customized Devise views by default.

A basic responsive app layout with top bar navigation is added.
A user profile page that displays some basic information about the user and
their recent forum posts is also added.

The app comes with basic styles (~10KiB gzipped, including Thredded styles)
that are written using [Sass].

The app's JavaScript code is loaded asynchronously in production mode via the
[`async`] attribute on the script tag. In development, the individual script
files are not concatenated. With `async` they would load out-of-order, so
[`defer`] is used instead.

**NB:** While loading scripts via `async` provides the best possible speed,
a lot of JavaScript libraries do not support it.
**If** you plan on adding JavaScript code, you might want to
**remove the `async` attribute** from the `javascript_include_tag` in
`app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`.

A [Dockerfile] and [docker-compose.yml] is generated for development.
This is so that other engineers can spin up a development environment with
a single command.

A production configuration file for the [puma] Ruby web server is created.
A `Procfile` process description file that can be used by that can be used by
the [Heroku] hosting platform or the [foreman] app runner is also be created.

Lastly, the `$APP` database user is created and given rights to the app's
development and test databases. Then, the database is created, the migrations
are run, and the database is seeded with an admin user and a messageboard.

Finally, the tests are run, and the development web server is started at
<http://localhost:3000>.

### Next steps

To learn about customizing the forums, see the [Thredded Readme].

To learn about customizing the authentication system, e.g. to require email
confirmation or to add an OAuth login, see the [Devise Readme].

To change the homepage, edit the view file at `app/views/home/show.html.erb`.

To change the app's styles, see the files in `app/assets/stylesheets`.
The app is generated with a randomly selected primary theme color that you may
want to change. You can find it in `app/assets/stylesheets/_variables.scss`.

You can contact the Thredded team via the [Thredded chat room].

## Development

The instructions below are for developing and contributing to
the Thredded app generator itself, not for using it.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To generate an app with `thredded_create_app` at `tmp/myapp`, run:

```sh
bundle exec bin/create-tmp-myapp
```

This command will clean up the previously generated app before creating a new one.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`,
which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
